# Hackerspace: Basic USB-C LED PCB project

This is a basic KiCad 9 project, containing a simple USB-C LED PCB project.
KiCad is a free/libre and open-source project (FLOSS), and you can download this
electronic design automation (EDA) software from
[their website](https://www.kicad.org/download/).

We assume that this PCB board will be manufactured by
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), so component sourcing is done through
[their parts catalogue](https://jlcpcb.com/parts/all-electronic-components), and
the PCB manufacturing capabilities are
[conformant to theirs](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-capabilities).

You may access the Hackerspace "_Intro to PCB Design_" workshop slides
[here](https://hckr.cc/hsp-pcb-intro).
